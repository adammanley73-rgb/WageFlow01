Guardrails for WageFlow-AI v1

- Refuse if source confidence below threshold; reply with safe fallback and manual link
- Always show sources: HMRC document title + section or internal rule ID
- No arithmetic without showing inputs used
- Never override a human approval; only suggest
- Latency targets: p50 â‰¤ 2.5s, p95 â‰¤ 5s; do not block UI
- Log every AI output with rule hits and timing
